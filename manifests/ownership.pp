# @summary
#   Manages the ownership of a specified path.
#
# @param user
#   Required. Specifies the user that should own this path. All files and directories under `path` will be owned by this user.
# @param group
#   Required. Specifies the group that should own this path. All files and directories under `path` will be owned by this group.
# @param path
#   The full path to the directory whose ownership should be managed. Defaults to the resource title.
#
# We provide this for a couple of reasons:
#  - IBM software wants to be installed as root.  It's possible to
#    install as a different user, but the Installation Manager (the package
#    manager) data won't know about that installation.  To keep things
#    centralized so that we can reliably query it, we install as root.
#  - Since we installed as root, the instance is "owned" by root.  This seems
#    to cause some configuration tasks to fail to run, even if the "profiles"
#    are owned by the service account.  E.g. some tasks attempt to create
#    file locks within the instance directory that's owned by root.
#  - Basically, we need to install as root and then make sure the thing gets
#    owned by the service account afterwards.
#  - Ultimately, this is what IBM documents - a series of 'chown' on various
#    directories.
